This is a bit of a lighter lab since your focus will mainly be on Assignment I at this point. The exercises aim to help you build skills youâ€™ll be using in the assignment.

**Object-Oriented Design**

- Design Object-Oriented solutions for simple problem domains
- Practice creating UML Diagrams
- Create custom exception classes in Java

Testing in Java

- Practice writing tests tests with JUnit
- Use coverage checkers on Java programs

# Marking

When marking your design and programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:

- Exercise is submitted on time;
- Code passes pipeline with provided JUnit tests / your tests;
- Code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
- Code is written cleanly and with good style;
- Solution is well-designed, using the design principles and patterns intended by the activity;
- Answers to theory questions address all aspects of the question;
- Any blog posts are consistent with the code/design being described;
- Reflections and rationale are comprehensive and thoughtful
- Any other requirements are outlined in the problem specification.

Many lab exercises in future weeks will consist of a practical design and programming exercise and a written blog post reflecting on the activity. During marking you should bring up your code and your blog post and talk through your solution, thought process and reflections using your blog post as a prompt.
