 > Week 7
Meet with louis on Monday and did a little breakdown of how we should tackle the assignment. As we both have varying commitments to other subjects we are going to be a little out of sync. I did a break down of Task 1 and sent it. I think this should be relatively equal and with the amount of time we have left should be super variable if either of us encounters any problems.

So far I have completed Task 1 A with the exception of some Gradle issues

> Week 8
So far I have fully completed and merged Task 1 A and Task 1 C, These where pretty easy and caused little problems. Task 1 D was a little larger than I anticipated primarily due to me having to figure out how the game handles onOverlap calls, once this was figured out it became a lot easier. WHile I am going to merge T1D into master soon I fully expect I will have to fully refactor how the game calls on overlap. It needs to be consistent rather than based on what gets "stepped on" as this causes a lot of bloat and inconsistency errors.
