 > Week 7
Meet with louis on Monday and did a little breakdown of how we should tackle the assignment. As we both have varying commitments to other subjects we are going to be a little out of sync. I did a break down of Task 1 and sent it. I think this should be relatively equal and with the amount of time we have left should be super variable if either of us encounters any problems.

So far I have completed Task 1 A with the exception of some Gradle issues

> Week 8
So far I have fully completed and merged Task 1 A and Task 1 C, These where pretty easy and caused little problems. Task 1 D was a little larger than I anticipated primarily due to me having to figure out how the game handles onOverlap calls, once this was figured out it became a lot easier. WHile I am going to merge T1D into master soon I fully expect I will have to fully refactor how the game calls on overlap. It needs to be consistent rather than based on what gets "stepped on" as this causes a lot of bloat and inconsistency errors. 

I also did half of T1F and Started on T2D, so far they have been going well without any real issues. I am not too sure what else to refactor but i assume I will have plenty of time to do this as I approach the due date.

> Week 9
I have fully completed T2D and will be shortly adding tests to ensure there are no bugs hiding within the code. 

Task 2 D and Task 2 F have been fully completed and merged, I wrote the tests and louis would bugfix any problems I found while testing. I'm hoping to merge the first half of Task 1 F in so I can get started on the second half of the refactoring.

The second half of refactoring has been very difficult. Im not entirely sure what i can actually refactor without breaking and the code seems decently solid all things considered. For the second half of task 1 F i decided to go small and just implement a stratergy pattern into zombie movement. This should make it easier to read/ understand while also making it much easier to further in the future.
