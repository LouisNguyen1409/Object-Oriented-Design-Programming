# Shopping Refactor

A service provider offers checkout services to the two most popular supermarkets in Australia: Coles and Woolworths.

The starter code provided models a fully correct software solution for the checkout process. However, the code has significant design flaws. You need to do the following:

In a blog post, briefly describe the Design Smells you identified, justify a series of refactoring choices both at low-level (code level) and high level (use a suitable design pattern, if required). Refactor the code to remove the Design Smells, and if required, use a design pattern(s) discussed in the course for refactoring.

We will provide a complete suite of tests for you. After refactoring, the behaviour of the system should remain unchanged (i.e. the tests should still pass unchanged).
