## Overview & Product Specification

Inside [`src/main/java/hotel`](/src/main/java/hotel) there is some starter code for the backend of a hotel booking system. The system is designed to address the following requirements:

- There are three types of **Room**:
  - Standard rooms;
  - Ensuite rooms;
  - Penthouse rooms
- A **Hotel** has a series of rooms and a name.
- Rooms can be booked from a start date to an end date, and the client can specify which of the types of rooms they wish to book
- Each type of room has its own custom welcome message.

## Task 1) Architecture Analysis

Start by taking a look at the `BookingSystemController` class. You do not need to understand all of the code in it, some of the constructs such as Streams we will be learning about in later weeks.

The diagram below illustrates the overall system structure.

![Hotel Architecture](/images/HotelArchitecture.png)

The booking system is broadly speaking an **Abstract Data Type** (ADT) - it is a system that contains information (data), has meaning (type) and functions as a **black box** (is abstract). This means that the system can be used by different **ADT Clients** who can each create an instance of and use the system **without understanding how it is implemented under the hood**. For example in the diagram above, ADT Clients of the booking system could include the tests we have written or an API layer that is using the `BookingSystemController`, or a Command Line Interface which acts as a wrapper around the controller.

**Q1: Why is this approach considered good design? Write the answer in your blog for this activity. In your answer, consider the terms abstraction, encapsulation and modularisation.**

**Q2: What is meant by the term "black-box"? How are the tests inside BookingSystemTest black-box?**

In the proceeding tasks, you will be able to edit any of the classes inside the `hotel` package except for `BookingSystemController`. You should not need to edit it, though you can modify the internal mechanics of the class if you like without changing the external interface (public methods).

## Task 2) Code Analysis

Look at the code inside the [`Hotel`](/src/main/java/hotel/Hotel.java) class. In particular, look at the `makeBooking` method.

```java
/**
 * Makes a booking in any available room with the given preferences.
 *
 * @param arrival
 * @param departure
 * @param standard - does the client want a standard room?
 * @param ensuite - does the client want an ensuite room?
 * @param penthouse - does the client want a penthouse room?
 * @return If there were no available rooms for the given preferences, returns false.
 * Returns true if the booking was successful
 */
public boolean makeBooking(LocalDate arrival, LocalDate departure, boolean standard, boolean ensuite, boolean penthouse) {
    for (Room room : rooms) {
        if (roomDesired(room, standard, ensuite, penthouse) && room.book(arrival, departure) != null) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Q3: What does this method do? What does it return, and what side effects does it have? Write your answer in your blog.**

<details>
  <summary>Side Effect</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

In the addRoom method there are two ways of creating a new room. One has been commented out in the actual code.

---

**Code A**

```java
public void addRoom(String roomType) {
    Room room = null;
    switch (roomType) {
        case "standard":
            room = new StandardRoom(); break;
        case "ensuite":
            room = new EnsuiteRoom(); break;
        case "penthouse":
            room = new PenthouseRoom(); break;
    }
    rooms.add(room);
}
```

---

**Code B**

```java
public void addRoom(String roomType) {
    switch (roomType) {
        case "standard":
            rooms.add(new StandardRoom()); break;
        case "ensuite":
            rooms.add(new EnsuiteRoom()); break;
        case "penthouse":
            rooms.add(new PenthouseRoom()); break;
    }
}
```

---

**Q4: In your opinion, which is better quality code, Code A or B? Justify your answer.**

Once you have done this delete the other block of code in the method.

## Task 3) Refactoring a Method

Consider the method `roomDesired` in the [`Hotel`](/src/main/java/hotel/Hotel.java) class.

```java
private boolean roomDesired(Room room, boolean standard, boolean ensuite, boolean penthouse) {
    if (room instanceof StandardRoom) {
        if (standard)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    } else if (room instanceof EnsuiteRoom) {
        if (ensuite)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    } else if (room instanceof PenthouseRoom) {
        if (penthouse)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Q5: What are some code smells (features of the code that make it poor quality) present in this method?**

**Task**: Refactor the method into a single statement.

Inside [`BookingSystemTests`](/src/test/java/hotel/BookingSystemTest.java) there is a subset of the tests called `RefactoringRegressionTests`. The tests are currently passing - you need to ensure that they stay passing. When refactoring code, it is important that the correctness of the system is maintained (i.e. the tests stay passing).

## Task 4) Refactoring the Design

Consider the architecture of the system more broadly. The code currently uses an interface Room, and the three different types of rooms are modelled as `StandardRoom`, `EnsuiteRoom` and `PenthouseRoom` which all implement `Room`.

What do you notice? Recall concepts of code style from COMP1511 and basic Software Engineering Design Principles from COMP1531 - **DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself** and **KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid**.

**Q6: In your blog, note down all of the code smells you can see.**

**Task**: Refactor the `Room` classes to remove the smells and improve the quality of the design. Make sure that the `RefactoringRegressionTests` remain passing.

**Q7: Once you have done the refactoring, in your blog reflect on your thought process, the steps you took to refactor and how you have improved the design of the system.**

Here is a hint to help you if you are stuck. Try figuring it out on your own first! Look at the tutorial/lecture content for ideas. We want you to be able to put the puzzle pieces together yourself üôÇ.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Consider changing the inheritance structure in your refactoring to reduce the
  repeated code.
</details>

Here is another hint in case you are still really stuck, **but try and figure it out with the pieces you have first!**

But if you still are stuck, then have a peek üôÇ.

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Currently, the code uses an <code>interface</code> - change it to use an <code>abstract class</code> instead.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

## Task 5) Overlaps

Well done, you've completed the refactoring! Now it's time to finish off the system.

Complete the `overlaps` method inside the [`Booking`](/src/main/java/hotel/Booking.java) class. `Task5OverlapsTests` will check your implementation is correct.

```java
/**
 * Checks whether two dates overlap
 * @param start
 * @param end
 */
public boolean overlaps(LocalDate start, LocalDate end) {
    return false;
}
```

## Task 6) `toJSON`

Implement the `toJSON` method in all classes that contain its stub. `Task6JSONTests` will check your implementation is correct.

Have a look at the [**JSON Library Documentation**](https://stleary.github.io/JSON-java/index.html) for how to work with JSON in Java. The `JSONObject` and `JSONArray` sections will help you with this exercise.

Here is a hint if you are still struggling with using JSON in Java.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at the <code>Task6JSONTests</code>.</li>
    <li>
      When comparing date objects, use the <code>toString</code> method on the
      date object.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

## Core Blogging: Reflect on the Hotel Lab

Well done on making it to the end! This was an extensive exercise. Finish up your answers to the questions, and **write a short reflection on the activity containing what you learned and any challenges you faced**. Once you have done this post your blog!!!
