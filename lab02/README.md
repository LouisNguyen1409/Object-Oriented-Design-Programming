# Aims

**What is this lab aiming to achieve?**

Now we’re settled into the course, it’s time to get our hands dirty. Lab 02 is an opportunity for you to deep-dive into the skills that will form the foundation of the rest of the course - more Java programming, OO Programming - and most importantly - **thinking about what makes good design**.

You might find parts of this lab challenging - particularly the Hotel exercise - that’s ok! For many students, working on design problems is a new way of thinking you haven’t had much experience with before 🧠 Patience and good time management is key here.

**Object-Oriented Design & Java Programming**

- Understand the Object-Oriented principles of abstraction and encapsulation
- Utilise inheritance and polymorphism to create abstractions
- Work with abstract classes and interfaces
- Work with JSON in Java

**Working on a system started by someone else**

- Revise concepts of code style and practice analysing code
- Develop skills in refactoring and removing simple code smells

To submit, push your commits to the **master** branch.

# Marking

When marking your design and programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:

- Exercise is submitted on time;
- Code passes pipeline with provided JUnit tests / your tests;
- Code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
- Code is written cleanly and with good style;
- Solution is well-designed, using the design principles and patterns intended by the activity;
- Answers to theory questions address all aspects of the question;
- Any blog posts are consistent with the code/design being described;
- Reflections and rationale are comprehensive and thoughtful
- Any other requirements are outlined in the problem specification.

Many lab exercises in future weeks will consist of a practical design and programming exercise and a written blog post reflecting on the activity. During marking you should bring up your code and your blog post and talk through your solution, thought process and reflections using your blog post as a prompt.
