# 🛰️ Core Exercise: Satellite

A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. In this exercise, you will create an class that represents a satellite, and using this class create a series of Satellite object instances.

Satellites have the following attributes/characteristics:

- A `name` (String)
- A `height` in kilometres above the centre of the earth (integer)
- A `velocity` in metres per second (double)
- A `position`, which is an angle `θ` in **degrees** of the satellite relative to the x-axis, anticlockwise.
- All of the above attributes can be retrieved using a _getter_ function and set using a _setter_ function
- The position of the satellite can be retrieved in radians as well as degrees
- The angular velocity of the satellite, (radians per second) can be found as well as the linear velocity (metres per second)
- Given a length of time in seconds, the distance the satellite has travelled can be found.

You have been given a series of function definitions inside [`src/main/java/satellite/Satellite.java`](/src/main/java/satellite/Satellite.java). Implement these functions according to the docstrings and the above requirements.

Once you have done this, write a `main` method that does the following:

- Creates Satellite A, which is `10000` km above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `55` metres per second and at `θ = 122`.
- Creates Satellite B, which is `5438` km above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `234` kilometres per second and at `θ = 0`.
- Creates Satellite C, which is `9029` km above the centre of the earth, with a velocity of `0` metres per second and at `θ = 284`.
- For Satellite A, print out `I am {name} at position {theta} degrees, {height} km above the centre of the earth and moving at a velocity of {velocity} metres per second`.
- Change Satellite A's height to `9999`.
- Change Satellite B's angle to `45`.
- Change Satellite C's velocity to `36.5` metres per second.
- Print out Satellite A's position in radians.
- Print out Satellite B's angular velocity.
- Print out the distance Satellite C travels after 2 minutes.

## Expected Output

```
I am Satellite A at position 122.0 degrees, 10000 km above the centre of the earth and moving at a velocity of 55.0 metres per second
2.129301687433082
0.04303052592865024
4380.0
```

To test if your output is correct, you can run the test file [`src/test/java/satellite/SatelliteTest.java`](/src/test/java/satellite/SatelliteTest.java) in VSCode.

  <summary>Tips</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>
      You will need to store all of the attributes as fields in the class. This
      can be done above your constructor by declaring each field. For example:
      <br />
      <code>private String name;</code><br />
      You don't have to set the field to be any particular value (they will be
      null by default for objects, and 0 for primitive data types like
      integers).
    </li>
    <li>
      In the constructor, initialise all of the fields to the parameters using
      the syntax: <br />
      <code>this.name = name;</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      You can convert between degrees and radians using
      <code>Math.toDegrees(theta)</code> and <code>Math.toRadians(theta)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The formula for conversion between linear and angular velocity is 
      <code>linear velocity = radius * angular velocity</code> i.e. 
      <code>angular velocity = linear velocity / radius</code>. Think about what
      the 'radius' is here!
