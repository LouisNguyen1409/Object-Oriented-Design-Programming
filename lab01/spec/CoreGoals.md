# ðŸ’­ Core Blogging: Goal Setting & Looking Ahead

Goal setting is a big part of professional development and personal growth. It's important to have something to aim for. We've talked about the intended learning outcomes and what we teach in this course - but this course is about you! We want you to spend some time at the beginning of the course thinking about what you want to get out of the next 10 weeks.

In [`blog.md`](/blog.md), and in it answer the following questions.

- What do you want to get out of this course?
- What skills do you want to develop and improve?
- What do you think will be the biggest challenge of the course? How will you go about meeting this challenge?
