# üç© Core Exercise: Check-in

In [`blog.md`](/blog.md) take some time to reflect on how you think you are going in the course.

It's a good time to take a brief pause and take stock of where we're at before we move into the second half of the term.

- How do you think you are going in the course?
- What has been the most difficult/challenging part of the course so far?
- Look back at the goals you set in Week 1. How are they tracking?
- What is one thing you want to improve for the second half of the term?
