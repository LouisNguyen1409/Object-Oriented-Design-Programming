How does the initial code break the open/closed principle, and how does the state pattern fix it?
The initial code breaks this principle since it requires modification to add new functionality. The State Pattern fixes this by allowing the behavior of an object to change based on its internal state, without modifying its class.

What is the difference between the Strategy Pattern and the state pattern? What makes this an example of the State Pattern?
The State pattern deals with what (state or type) an object is.
The Strategy pattern deals with how an object performs a certain task.
